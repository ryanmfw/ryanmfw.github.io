I just found a YouTube channel that is totally underappreciated: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEpx2l9WZ3jyCCcCKheKi4g](Roll Call)

It's mostly a weekly compilation of clips from Congress. For a political junkie with too little time, this is a very convenient format. I hope it continues, but considering the production quality and the number of people involved, with the low number of views, I kind of worry...
