description: Falcon 9 failure

On its 19th flight, SpaceX's Falcon 9 suffered a loss of vehicle (it blew up), while carrying a cargo Dragon with a bunch of supplies. The ISS is running a little low on food and may have to abandon the station if the Russians can't get a Progress up there to resupply on July 3rd. This is unlikely though.

It appears the second stage LOX tank became overpressurized, and we'll hopefully know why that happened soon. There's going to be a press conference in a little bit going through what they know.

While in its own right, this is an awful shame, it also concerns me that this might make it easier for the United Launch Alliance to successfully lobby Congress to kill off SpaceX's participation in Commercial Crew. That would be the real tragedy here - killing off a better and further along program by replacing it with an essentially nonexistent one.

In some good news, it appears the cargo Dragon escaped relatively unscathed, even though it doesn't have a launch escape system (I believe):

At least its destruction was quite pretty, although nothing would have been nicer than to see it land on an ASDS <strike>barge</strike>craft.
