Tomorrow, Greece's banks won't open, and seemingly the last hope for an agreement with its creditors is a referendum on an already defunct proposal. I see no reason to expect the intransigence on either side to disappear. This is why Grexit is one of my few positional trades on [PredictIt](/projects/predictit).
