description: Chicago is great, but where I live is boring
---

I don't live in the most exciting part of Chicago, a frustrating fact that I've lived through for nearly two years due to my general disdain for actually moving. What makes it worse is that in every aspect other than "having a pulse," I'm actually really well situated.
*Nice apartment in a nice building
*Central location - close to transit
*Close to work
*Rent is reasonable/good landlord

All basic stuff that makes a place worth living in. However, there is nothing going on, ever. Most of the restaurants close at 4 PM on weekdays and don't open on weekends. There's no foot traffic, no culture, no quirky stores. Few events overall. It's just the same boringness every day. As well, most of my friends live some distance away.

Do I want to trade convenience for enjoyment? Most likely. The main inconvenience is my commute, so something located near the blue or red lines would be ideal. Some sort of night life or culture comes next, so I'm looking at Lincoln Park or Logan Square, maybe Wicker Park. 

Shall I rent? Or buy and reduce my costs with roommates? I'm inclined to continue renting, as I don't really want to be tied down too much.
I'll probably break down the cost/benefit analysis of buying and renting it out later.
