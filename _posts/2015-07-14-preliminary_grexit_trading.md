description: Initial results of grexit trading on predictit

There were some interesting days recently, and from the prices below it is pretty clear how volatile this contract has been - over the past two weeks Grexit has traded between 15 and 65 delta... It reached its peak when oxi/no surprisingly won the referendum and dropped to its low when it was announced late Sunday night that Tsirpas had reached an agreement to be announced in the morning. That was a precipitous drop from earlier that weekend when the rest of Europe looked comfortable with
"temporary" Grexit if Greece couldn't enact the not-yet-agreed-upon terms within 3 days. Crazy!

I don't think Greece wants to or is in the near term capable of leaving the Eurozone, and I'm of the opinion that their creditors don't actually want them to leave either - they're just very good at playing chicken. So mainly my belief is that Grexit isn't terribly likely this year, but it's not going to be solved either, and there will likely be several crises that flare up, making it worthwhile to buy in when the market is oversold (and the market seems to overshoot a _lot_).

Today was a bit interesting, as I was pretty long, and there was a huge gap behind the 4th level, from 30c to 44c. By doubling my position at a cost of roughly 28c, I cleared everything out and then layered the offer around 42c. This was something I've wanted to try for a bit and this was a fairly good opportunity, as I could hack out at 26c. While my offers didn't get lifted, unsurprisingly, the market did shift up a couple of cents and I was able to scratch. It was actually looking
quite good, but I wound up hacking out the last 100 contracts at the end as the bid was getting very weak.

### Lessons learned:

* I need to trade larger size at lower prices - I'm used to buying pricier contracts in a previous arb
* I have been mostly one sided, although this is somewhat a product of how things have been moving
* I need to be a bit more aggressive about getting out of bad positions

### Details

All trades were Yes contracts, with profit based on what PredictIt reported, which does not appear to have much rhyme or reason.
