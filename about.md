I'm Ryan Wendt, a developer and data scientist in the trading industry. I spend my days using data to improve our strategies and address ever changing markets. I lead a team of researchers working on this problem across a range of products and exchanges, and run another team that is delivering a next-gen data platform.

Otherwise, I'm a giant space nerd, a fan of skiing, and I enjoy watching terrible movies.
