PredictIt is a political prediction market, in the vein of the long standing Iowa Electronic Market, or the now defunct Intrade. You can trade binary, yes or no contracts, that pay off a dollar if you are correct, and nothing otherwise.

On a basic level, this is pretty interesting, and what really brought me into the site was when I realized there were significant arbitrage opportunities in certain contracts. For the moment, I won't detail these opportunities since they still exist, although it has been harder as of late to find them.

There are some frustrating aspects to the site, anyway:
* 5% withdrawal fee
* 10% fee on profits
* No data or trading API
* Can only take a position in yes or no at any given time

The last is particularly frustrating for market making - essentially there are four sides (although two of them mirror the other two), but you are restricted to only one of two of those sides at any time. Ideally, you would be able to buy yes and buy no at the same time.

Just based on the order books for certain contracts, it appears that there are people who are opening up multiple accounts to get around this restriction. If this setup requires frequent rebalancing, the 5% withdrawal fee has to be quite painful.
