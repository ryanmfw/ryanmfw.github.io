PredictIt is a political prediction market, in the vein of the long standing Iowa Electronic Market, or the now defunct Intrade. You can trade binary, yes or no contracts, that pay off a dollar if you are correct, and nothing otherwise.

On a basic level, this is pretty interesting, and what really brought me into the site was when I realized there were significant arbitrage opportunities in certain contracts. For the moment, I won't detail these opportunities since they still exist, although it has been harder as of late to find them.

There are some frustrating aspects to the site, anyway:

* 5% withdrawal fee
* 10% fee on profits
* Few contracts
* Clunky/slow interface
* No data or trading API
* Can only take a position in yes or no at any given time

The last is particularly frustrating for market making - essentially there are four sides (although two of them mirror the other two), but you are restricted to only one at any time: buying yes or buying no. Ideally, you would be able to buy yes and buy no at the same time.

Just based on the order books for certain contracts, it appears that there are people who are opening up multiple accounts to get around this restriction. If this setup requires frequent rebalancing, the 5% withdrawal fee has to be quite painful.

The next greatest concern is the small number of contracts, especially ones that expire soon, as well as PredictIt's choice of markets. This isn't too bad, as it means the already small liquidity isn't spread out among even more markets. PredictIt offers one or two weekly markets, usually on approval ratings, for Obama and the Congress. They've played around with this significantly, changing the source of the approval ratings from one third party combination of multiple polls, to separate
markets for different pollsters, and finally their own average. These varying specifications have had profound effects on how the market operates and my own success. 

Lastly, I have no theoretical values and rarely any opinions about the outcomes of these markets. I've made a few good plays when the market was obviously out of whack, but for the most part I try to identify arbitrage opportunities or look for wide markets to join.
