title: Satellite Observations
---

Following in the footsteps of Marco Longbroek at [SatTrackCam](https://sattrackcam.blogspot.com/), I've started putting together a LEO satellite observation setup, consisting of:
* Watec 902H2 Low Light Camera
* Samyang 1.4/85mm Lens
* Yotocap AV USB capture
* A terrible tripod

It was surprisingly easy to get all of this working - I was worried about converting formats from the Watec security camera into something that could be captured, but it's in fact all composite video.

So far, I've captured a few satellites but I haven't been particularly successful at capturing any specific satellites or measuring anything about them.

There are several areas for improvement:
* Timing
* Stuck pixels in the camera
* Pointing
