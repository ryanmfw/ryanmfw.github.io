title: Modular Synthesizer
---

A synthesizer is an instrument that lets one produce sounds or music electrically (as opposed to electronically). That is you can produce sounds/waveforms with things like filters and voltage controlled oscillators. A modular synth is all about building the individual components of a synth in a modular way, allowing the parts to be used in various traditional and new ways.

I'd like to say I'm doing this all on my own, but really I'm basing it a lot on the Lunetta style CMOS synthesizers, where classic ICs are used for (somewhat) unintended purposes. I'm also following along with the [Logic Noise](http://hackaday.com/tag/logic-noise/) tutorials on hackaday.

Current status: I have parts. And noise. The noise is what I expected, but I think I already blew one of my ICs, because it gets unseasonably hot in normal operation (I might have plugged it in backwards at one point...).
