title: Modular Synthesizer
---

A synthesizer is an instrument that lets one produce sounds or music electrically (as opposed to electronically). That is you can produce sounds/waveforms with things like filters and voltage controlled oscillators. A modular synth is all about building the individual components of a synth in a modular way, allowing the parts to be used in various traditional and new ways.
